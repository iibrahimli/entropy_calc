Text Using standard ASCII representation, each character (letter, space,
punctuation mark, etc.) in a text document requires 8 bits or 1 byte.
Suppose we have a fairly dense text with 50 lines of text per page and 100
characters per line. This would give 5 kB per page. If the text were a hefty
1000 pages, this would result in 5 MB. Alternatively, if we assume one word
is on average 6 characters, then each word requires approximately 6 bytes.
Therefore, a one million word document would require approximately 6
MB. Although these numbers may sound big, remember that this is for a
very large text document. As we’ll see other media result in significantly
more data.

Audio In digital audio, it’s typical to use 16 bits per sample and 44,100
samples per second, resulting in 706 kb/sec or 88.2 kB/sec. With two
channels for stereo we would get 176 kB/sec. Therefore, just 30 seconds
of digital audio requires almost 5.3 MB, which is more than the 1000 page
text document. An hour of two-channel audio results in about 635 MB.

Images For a gray scale image, it’s typical to use 8 bits/pixel. A good
resolution image might be 512×512 pixels, which would result in 0.26 MB.
For a color image, we need to multiply by 3 for the three color components,
resulting in about 0.786 MB. Assuming our previous estimate, of about
6 characters per word, this means such an image is worth more 100,000
words, rather than 1,000 words! Only 7 such images would result in about
5.5 MB, more than the 1000 page text document.

Video A standard frame rate for video is about 30 frames/sec. Using
the estimates for images, we get about 7.86 MB/sec for black/white video
and about 23.6 MB/sec for color video. This means that just one second
of black/white video or 1/4 of a second of color video results in more
data than the 1000 page text document. One minute of black/white video
requires about 472 MB, while one minute of color video requires 1.416 GB.
A two hour black/white video requires 56.6 GB, while a two hour color
video requires almost 170 GB!

The estimates above assume the data is represented directly in raw format
(e.g., one byte for each character, one byte per gray scale pixel, etc.). The goal
of compression is to represent signals (or more general data) in a more efficient
form. Compression is extremely useful for both storage and transmission.
Of course, the need for compression is dependent on storage and commu-
nication technology. The estimates above are best appreciated in the context
of typical capacities of storage media and data rates for communication. Some
typical digital storage media and their capacities are floppy disk (about 1.4 MB),
zip disk (100 MB or 250 MB), CD (about 700 MB), DVD (4.25 GB single-sided,
8.5 GB double-sided, 18 GB double-sided and dual density). Some typical data
rates for wired communication are 56 kb/sec for phone line modems, ...
Although capacities of storage media and communication data rates available
for most users have been increasing rapidly, the demand for data has kept pace.
So far, it appears that “if the capacity is available the bits will come”. Moreover,
the demand for throughput in wireless communication has been rapidly increas-
ing and far outpacing the increases in efficiency in use of the limited spectrum.
These forces will ensure that compression remains an important topic for the
foreseeable future.
